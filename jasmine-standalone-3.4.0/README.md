# Thermostat

A simple business logic to model a thermostat, written in JavaScript, and connected to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery.

#### Instructions

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- Up function increases temperature
- Down function decreases temperature
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
